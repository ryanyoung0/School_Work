1.) Open a file in VIM : vi <filename>
2.) Enter input mode : press i
3.) save and close : :wq
4.) don't save and close : :q!
5.) in base mode use shift + v to select a line
6.) y is to copy
7.) p is to paste
8.) u is undo
9.) to check for zombie process use the <ps> command


Valgrind Notes:
1.) test for memory leaks: valgrind --leak-check=yes <program executable> might need to pass in the arguments as well

GDB Notes:
1.) q is quit
2.) list will display your code
3.) step will step to the next line of code and goes in functions aka if you call a smaller function in main it will go into that small function then keep going
4.) next will go to next line but not go into functions aka if you call a smaller function in main it will just run and get to next line
5.) b <line number> will set a breakpoint at this line of code
6.) Make sure you include the -g tag when you compile
7.) bt is back trace it will then tell you where the error is
8.) print <variable> will show you the variable
9.) can also print arrays and print array[x]

General C Syntax Notes:
1.) If you want to print anything with printf
you need to pass in a string first specifying what it is going to be so "%d" means i am going to print an integer
2.) need to define functions based off what they return
3.) need to define what types of paramters you are passing in when you pass into a helper function from a main function (inside the helper function, not when using it in the main function).
4.) & is the pointer symbol when you do scanf you need to use the pointer to assign that value to the variable you want to use.


Gerneral Linux Notes:
1.) Go back one level in the directory: cd
2.) Go back to the home level directory: cd /
3.) Copy a file from a.c to b.c in the current directory: cp <old file name> <new file name>
4.) Check if the word main appreas in the file a.c and b.c: NEED TO FIND THIS ONE
5.) LS (showing more information): ls -l gives us file sizes and date modified
6.) LS showing all files: ls -a shows all files even temps
7.) To have Linux show all files and or directorys that start with a letter: Example, changing directory, do cd / <tab> <tab again> <next letter> <tab again> <tab once more>
8.) How to have a manual for functions and commands show up: man -a <function or command you need>
9.) compile : cc - o <name you want the output to be> <name of c file>
10.) If we want to use gdb to debug we need to use gcc -o outname -g input file
11.) Make sure you clear out the executables before submitting the folder to mimir
